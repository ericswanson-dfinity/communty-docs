# Internet Computer Developer Documentation

This is an experimental approach to developer focused documentation on the Internet Computer.

The main Dfinity Foundation developer documentation can be found at the [DFINITY SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org/) and it is encouraged that all developers review the Official documentation for getting started on the Internet Computer.


This documentation is designed to be a self-service documentation tool for the Internet Computer developer community. This repository is open sourced and any developer can submit a pull request to have the documentation updated.

Stay tuned for more updates!
