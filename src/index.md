# Internet Computer Developer Documentation

This is an experimental approach to developer focused documentation on the Internet Computer.

For official Dfinity Foundation developer documentation visit [DFINITY SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org/)

To get started developing on the Internet Computer, visit the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) guides.

This documentation is designed to be a self-service documentation tool for the Internet Computer developer community. This repository is open sourced and any developer can submit a pull request to have the documentation updated.
